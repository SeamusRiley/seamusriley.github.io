### Type 
- Residential Detached Bedroom/Office

### Involvement
- Designed and built completely from scratch with the help of a few brothers
- Applied Joe Lstiburek’s continuous insulation and “perfect wall” concepts
- Worked with a metal fabrication shop to have cladding/roofing panels custom bent to size

### Narrative
I created the starship to be private and moveable workspace for my younger brother. The outward-canted walls came out of sensitivity to interior space. We were limited in floor space by moveability and regulation, so the question was "how can I make a <100 square foot building feel more spacious?" and the answer was to lean the walls out, and eliminate any cross-bridging through the space by supporting all lateral loads with two end trusses. The equilaterial star shape came out of material frugality, as I was able to build essentially the same framing and envelope assembly around all faces of the building with minimal remeasuring.
