In my first public speaking appearance I gave a breakout session talk at LevelUp 2025 in Orlando, FL. When I was invited to speak at the conference, I chose anxiety as a topic because I knew that I had a personal history with it, and had progressed significantly. I could have given a talk on architecture, but architecture is not as relevant for a philosophic audience, and it's not a widespread and topical social issue. With my topic decided, my goal was to integrate three things:
My story
Objectivism
Psychology
And I was pretty happy with the result!
