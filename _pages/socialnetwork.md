      <td>Discord is my primary social media. I like it because it has no ads, promoted content, or algorithm, and is just a big clubhouse for me and my friends.<br>It is also fully searchable, making it a great place to find random snippets of conversations that I had with Erek Webb four years ago.<br>I am on Discord all the time, and whenever I have multiple means to keep in touch with someone, Discord is my preferred. Every other social media platform and messaging avenue is just a way to reach people I don't already have on Discord.</td>

      <td>Generally speaking, phone is a more urgent means of reaching me. I will tend to respond to texts within 24 hours, but if you're cold-texting me, remember to introduce yourself as I may not have your contact info.<br>I also keep my phone on silent at all times except for certain individuals that have ring clearance, so texts are more reliable than calls.</td>
