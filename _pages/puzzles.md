Some people make Christmas cards, I make Christmas ciphers.

It is my annual tradition to draft a puzzle that celebrates whatever topic I learned about or focused on in the preceding year. It's an opportunity to flex my hand drafting skills, and to let people know how I'm doing and how I'm growing. Each puzzle that I send to a friend carries a unique serial number, but by popular demand, I have made generic bootleg scans of previous year puzzles available for download. (Some people want to test themselves against the previous year's puzzle, or print out copies for their children.)

If you do download a bootleg puzzle to enjoy, please leave an appropriate donation in my digital tip jar. Thanks!
