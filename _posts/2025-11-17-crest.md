Several years ago I was inspired by Arthur Zey's crest design, and immediately resolved to make one of my own. It took me a few years to work it out and have a use for it, but I finally finished my design in 2025.

Rabbit - Wit/Affection/Spontaneity (Favorite animal. Chinese zodiac year. reference to Chappell Roan, bugs bunny)
Plume - Courage (reference to Cyrano De Bergerac)
Dollar Sign - Trade (reference to Hugh Akston)
Willow Tree - Solitude
Clouds - Aspiration/Abstraction (head in the clouds)
House - Craftsmanship
Chicory - Love (drawn to look like a chimney sweep's brush in reference to Bert from Mary Poppins)
Pickaxe - Work/Industry (minecraft reference)
Microphone - Singing/speech/showmanship
Earth Symbol - Land, Reality, Pessimism (ATLA reference)

Meta Symbolism 
	1. Most values spring from earth, indicating a rational, objective, seeing-is-believing life philosophy.
	2. Compositionally it resembles a flower arrangement, my first job was arranging flowers
	3. The earth symbol resembles an ink well. Combined with the plume it implies a fondness for words, writing, and calligraphy. "The pen is mightier than the sword"
	4. The blue of the chicory flower is reflected in the rabbit's eye, indicating an eye for beauty and aesthetics 
	5. The microphone is positioned to the rabbit's mouth
	6. A house built on a cloud is impossible, but cloud cities rule in all fiction, so this implies unrepentant idealism in contrast to the earthly values below
        7. Miscellaneous values are positioned as blossoms on the chicory stalk.
