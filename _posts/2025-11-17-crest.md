Several years ago I was inspired by [Arthur Zey](https://www.arthurzey.com/about/)'s crest design, and immediately resolved to make one of my own. It took me a few years to work it out and have a use for it, but I finally finished my design in 2025.

- Jackrabbit - Wit/Affection/Spontaneity
  - I have an overbite and big front teeth.
  - I identified with rabbits from a very young age because the Tortoise And The Hare fable about the rabbit who gets way ahead and then takes a nap sounded like something I would do. I liked to run around and take naps. I also love love loved Bugs Bunny because he would always foil Elmer Fudd without firing a single shot. That combination of evasive maneuvers and ruthless mockery was 90% of how I playfought with my older brother, because I was far too shrimpy to ever best him in a match of muscles. I took on Bugs's habit of snacking on whole raw carrots, and carrot juice remains my favorite beverage to this day! When I discovered eventually that I had been born in the chinese zodiac year of the Rabbit, that only cemented the association in my mind, so rabbits have been and remain my favorite animal. As for the playboy-like appearance of my jackrabbit design, I choose to see it as a reference only to a good Chappell Roan song (Red Wine Supernova) and [the best interview with a philosopher to ever take place](https://rickbulow.com/Library/Books/Non-Fiction/AynRand/PlayboyInterview-AynRand_3-1964.pdf).

- Plume - Courage (reference to Cyrano De Bergerac)
- Dollar Sign - Trade (reference to Hugh Akston)
- Willow Tree - Solitude (my favorite tree)
- Clouds - Aspiration/Abstraction (head in the clouds)
- House - Craftsmanship
- Chicory - Love (drawn to look like a chimney sweep's brush in reference to Bert from Mary Poppins)
- Pickaxe - Work/Industry (minecraft reference)
- Microphone - Singing/speech/showmanship
- Earth Symbol - Land, Reality, Pessimism (ATLA reference)

Meta Symbolism 
- Most values spring from earth, indicating a rational, objective, seeing-is-believing life philosophy.
- Compositionally it resembles a flower arrangement, my first job was arranging flowers
- The earth symbol resembles an ink well. Combined with the plume it implies a fondness for words, writing, and calligraphy. "The pen is mightier than the sword"
- The blue of the chicory flower is reflected in the rabbit's eye, indicating an eye for beauty and aesthetics 
- The microphone is positioned to the rabbit's mouth
- A house built on a cloud is impossible, but cloud cities rule in all fiction, so this implies unrepentant idealism in contrast to the earthly values below
- Miscellaneous values are positioned as blossoms on the chicory stalk.
