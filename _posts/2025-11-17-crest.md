Several years ago I was inspired by Arthur Zey's crest design, and immediately resolved to make one of my own. It took me a few years to work it out and have a use for it, but I finally finished my design in 2025.

- Rabbit - Wit/Affection/Spontaneity (Favorite animal. Chinese zodiac year. reference to Chappell Roan, bugs bunny)
- Plume - Courage (reference to Cyrano De Bergerac)
- Dollar Sign - Trade (reference to Hugh Akston)
- Willow Tree - Solitude
- Clouds - Aspiration/Abstraction (head in the clouds)
- House - Craftsmanship
- Chicory - Love (drawn to look like a chimney sweep's brush in reference to Bert from Mary Poppins)
- Pickaxe - Work/Industry (minecraft reference)
- Microphone - Singing/speech/showmanship
- Earth Symbol - Land, Reality, Pessimism (ATLA reference)

Meta Symbolism 
- Most values spring from earth, indicating a rational, objective, seeing-is-believing life philosophy.
- Compositionally it resembles a flower arrangement, my first job was arranging flowers
- The earth symbol resembles an ink well. Combined with the plume it implies a fondness for words, writing, and calligraphy. "The pen is mightier than the sword"
- The blue of the chicory flower is reflected in the rabbit's eye, indicating an eye for beauty and aesthetics 
- The microphone is positioned to the rabbit's mouth
- A house built on a cloud is impossible, but cloud cities rule in all fiction, so this implies unrepentant idealism in contrast to the earthly values below
- Miscellaneous values are positioned as blossoms on the chicory stalk.
