Seamus Riley is an architecture designer at SmithGroup focusing on hospitals and a content creator at Objective Standard Institute (philosophy non-profit) focusing on lifestyle and psychology. He graduated at the top of his class in architectural technology with a $10,000 associate degree but couldn't justify putting any further money into education, and preferred to begin working. He started life as a conservative, but is now a sponsoring member at ProjectLiberal. His hobbies include singing, swing dancing, building with power tools, and engaging with kindred spirits on Discord. Find his philosophy on YouTube, his opinions on X, and his body and soul at his desk.
